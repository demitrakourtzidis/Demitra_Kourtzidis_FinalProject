# The U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world, and that's a problem for everyone.
Mass incarceration makes you less safe.
# Summary
The U.S. is the most incarcerated country in the world, and that has a negative impact on all of us. There are a lot of myths surrounding criminal justice policy that prevent reform, but in dispelling these myths, reform is possible.
# Outline
Introduction: The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Yes, that's including China and Russia. While the U.S. only accounts for 4% of the world population, our prisons and jails hold almost 25% of the world's incarcerated population (Viz 1). 

# How we got here
We weren't always like this. In fact, we had a pretty normal incarceration rate until the 1980s. American culture became extremely punitive (punishment-oriented) at that time, and experts point to a number of different causes (television, the Civil Rights Movement, rising crime rates). This phenomenon became known as the "tough on crime" movement. The federal goverment started passing laws to criminalize more behaviors and lengthen prison sentences. Most states followed closely behind, creating harsh sentencing laws that exploded the prison population. (I'll talk more about specifics and the timeline here.) - And, mass incarceration isn't really related to crime.

# Where we are now
Even though the federal government was the originator of tough on crime policy, mass incarceration is a state problem (Viz 2). State policy is what drives incarceration, which explains the huge differences in state incarceration rates. Many states have tried to change their criminal justice policies in the last decade. Most of them have had only modest successes. Turns out, it's really hard to change criminal justice policy for a number of reasons. 

# Stuff to keep in mind
1. We believe a lot of myths about who "criminals" are
If you've watched Law and Order, you've probably felt genuine anger and disgust at the show's villains. I'm sure those characters deserved your hatred because they're written that way on purpose. In real life, nobody is a "criminal." Many people break the law everyday; some get caught and most don't. The outcome pretty much depends on your zipcode. 

Let's do an exercise to help you think about this. Think about people you know and love, including yourself. Has anyone you know broken a law without getting caught? Here are some examples to help you brainstorm:
      - Being drunk in public
      - Peeing outside (this one can get you a spot on the sex offender registry!)
      - Giving alcohol to a minor
      - Committing sodomy (Not currently against the law, but there are still people on sex offender registries for this one)
      - Punching someone in the face
      - Smoking, snorting, shooting up X drug (Possession is technically the crime in these cases, but that has less pizzaz)
      
2. "But what about the Ted Bundys of the world?!"

This one's easy. There's a reason you know his name. There's a reason Zac Efron plays him in a movie. There are very few people like Ted Bundy, and he is certainly not representative of all or even most incarcerated people. Plus, no criminal justice reform would ever result in a judge letting a serial killer off with a warning. Criminal justice reform has nothing to do with Ted Bundy.

# How mass incarceration makes your life worse

# Calls to action
Call your legislators.
Vote for your local district attorney.
Hire people with prior convictions.
Vote for your local judges.
# Data

The bulk of my data are available here: https://www.prisonpolicy.org/data/

PrisonPolicy.org has the biggest (publicly available) collection of organized incarceration data in the country. These data show breakdowns of different incarcerated populations by gender, race, ethnicity, state, type of offense, etc. over time. The over time aspect will be important to show the growth of incarceration during the tough on crime era. 

The breakdown of incarcerated populations by type of offense is, in my opinion, the most salient piece. It will give me the opportunity to explain what different labels like "violent crime" actually mean. I want to take the power out of these labels because they are misleading. 

I will also have a bar chart to show how the US incarceration rate compares to other countries and a chart to show how states compare to each other. The latter helps make the point that incarceration is really a state-level issue. 

# Method and medium

I plan to use Shorthand for this project. I think a simple, clean, linear format fits this topic well. In addition to my data visualizations, I plan to use pictures of people that will evoke a sympathetic reaction and draw viewers in.
